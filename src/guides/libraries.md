# Libraries

You can separate content in different libraries, a library is a group of books. Libraries access can also be restricted to specific users.

Each library has a root folder, and no library can share any part of their path.

For example if you have a library with a root path of `/books/mangas`, you can't create a library with a root path of `/books`, because the two root paths would overlap. You can however create a library with a root path of `/books/comics`.
