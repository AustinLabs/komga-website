The administrator of a Komga server has the ability to create other User Accounts for that server.

You can manage Users in _Server Settings > Users_.

## User Roles

Users can have different roles, giving them the ability to do certain things.

### Administrator

An administrator can perform all the management actions:
- add, edit, and delete libraries
- add, edit, and delete users
- add, edit, and delete collections
- edit series and book metadata
- manually scan, analyze and refresh metadata

### Page Streaming

A user with this role will be able to stream individual pages, for example to read using the Webreader.

### File Download

A user with this role will be able to download the file of a book.

## Shared Libraries

An administrator can limit a particular user to see certain libraries. This is done via the _Edit Shared Libraries_ button.

Choose the libraries the user will be able to access, or select _All libraries_ for unrestricted access (this is the default option).
