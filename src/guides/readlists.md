# Read lists <Badge text="0.57.0+" />

Read lists let you gather related books together. Think of it as playlists, but for books. For example, you might add all the books where Wolverine appears together in a "Wolverine" read list.

## Adding books to a read list

You can add a Book to a read list from the action menu icon <img src="/assets/media/guides/action-menu-icon.png" style="vertical-align: middle" height="32" /> and click on _Add to read list_.

You can also select multiple books, and click on _Add to read list_.

A dialog will show up, where you can either add books to an existing read list, or create a new read list.

## Finding the Read Lists

Read lists can be discovered or viewed in three ways:
1. Book details screen
2. Viewing the libraries "By Read List"
3. Searching in the search bar

### Book details screen

When viewing the details screen for a specific book that belongs to a read list, the read list will be displayed in a collapsible panel.

Click on the panel to expand it and see the content of the read list.

### Viewing the libraries "By Read List"

Only show read lists that exist in the library. Opening a read list goes to the "read list details" screen (see below).

## Read List details

The read list details screen contains all the books that belong to the read list. It can include books from any library and any series. By adding items in different libraries or series to read lists, you can relate them to each other.

### Edit read list elements

From the read list details screen you can edit the elements composing a read list. To do so, click on the corresponding button in the toolbar.

The book cards will show two extra elements:
- a delete button, to remove the book from the read list
- a grip handle, which let you drag and drop books to reorder them

Once you are done with your changes, click the tick in the top bar. Click the cross to discard your changes.

## Deleting a read list

To delete a read list, look for the action menu icon <img src="/assets/media/guides/action-menu-icon.png" style="vertical-align: middle" height="32" /> and click on _Delete_.

This will not delete the items in the read list, nor your media files.
