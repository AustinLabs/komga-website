# Jar

:::tip Tip
Since `v0.20.0` it's not required anymore to have an `application.yml` for Komga to run properly.
:::

You can run Komga from the fat `jar` file. You can download them in the [releases](https://github.com/gotson/komga/releases) section.

In order to run Komga, use the following command:

```shell script
java -jar komga-x.y.z.jar
```

## Updating

To update just stop Komga, then start it with the latest `jar.
